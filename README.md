# **Runtime-Checker**
A Simple python script to check the how long does it take for a file to run


# **WHAT IT DOES**
**It will run the program and tell how long it took to run the code. </br>**
<sub> The Runtime is not certain it can change </sub>

# **SUPPORTED FILE EXTENTIONS**
- Java
- C
- C++
- Python</br>

<sub> Working on it, to support more languages </sub>

# **HOW IT WORKS**

On the first run it will create the `dest.txt` file and a folder `check_code` in the same directory as the script</br>
and store the destination of the `check_code` folder. If it doesnt find the `check_code` folder then it will check inside the **dest.txt**</br>
and if theres any destination saved it will use it to make the folder

> [!NOTE]
> The `dest.txt` file is necessery for this script to meet the requirements. **But you can always create them on your own**

> [!TIP]
> Now suppose you want to change the the `check_code` folder </br>
> to a differnt location then all you need to do is make another folder called `check_code` (<ins>case sensitive</ins>) and copy</br>
> the destination of the folder and paste it in the `dest.txt` file and you should be good.
